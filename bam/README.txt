The BamValidator processes the specified SAM/BAM file:

   1. to determine if it has any syntactic or format violations.
   2. to generate basic statistics. 

The user can then decide if they want to use the file for future processing based on whether it passed syntactic/format validation and based on the statistics that were reported. 

Documentation and download of the BAM Validator is found at: http://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/BamValidator
