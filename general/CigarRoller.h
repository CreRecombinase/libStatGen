// Clipped alignment. In Smith-Waterman alignment, a sequence may not be aligned from the first residue to the last one.
// Subsequences at the ends may be clipped off. We introduce operation ʻSʼ to describe (softly) clipped alignment. Here is
// an example. Suppose the clipped alignment is:
// REF:  AGCTAGCATCGTGTCGCCCGTCTAGCATACGCATGATCGACTGTCAGCTAGTCAGACTAGTCGATCGATGTG
// READ:        gggGTGTAACC-GACTAGgggg
// where on the read sequence, bases in uppercase are matches and bases in lowercase are clipped off. The CIGAR for
// this alignment is: 3S8M1D6M4S.
//
//
// If the mapping position of the query is not available, RNAME and
// CIGAR are set as “*”
//
// A CIGAR string is comprised of a series of operation lengths plus the operations. The conventional CIGAR format allows
// for three types of operations: M for match or mismatch, I for insertion and D for deletion. The extended CIGAR format
// further allows four more operations, as is shown in the following table, to describe clipping, padding and splicing:
//
// op   Description
// --   -----------
// M    Match or mismatch
// I    Insertion to the reference
// D    Deletion from the reference
// N    Skipped region from the reference
// S    Soft clip on the read (clipped sequence present in <seq>)
// H    Hard clip on the read (clipped sequence NOT present in <seq>)
// P    Padding (silent deletion from the padded reference sequence)
//

    // increases the offset, delete decreases it).

    // The use case for this is when we have a genome match
    // position based on an index word other than the first one,
    // and there is also a insert or delete between the beginning
    // of the read and the index word.  We can't simply report
    // the match position without taking into account the indels,
    // otherwise we'll be off by N where N is the sum of this
    // indel count.
